Vertiv / Liebert RPP device

For the new simulation I would like to give you 2 options:

A simple option, where I just make a new configuration reusing the simulator as it is, installing it to run in parallel (different port).

An advanced option (includes the simple option):
Enhance the simulator with:
- new mode (configurable), making the registers return the register number as value. This option makes it very easy for testers to control that the correct register is read
- Web page / REST-API allowing testers to set the value of single registers. This option allows testers have the web page open, alongside the app, change a value and control the effect in the app.
This will be available for both simulators!

The price would be:
- Simple option: 800,- EUR
- Advanced option: 1.500,- EUR
Down payment: 500,- EUR

The prices include continued support and help in the same manner as I have done until now.
